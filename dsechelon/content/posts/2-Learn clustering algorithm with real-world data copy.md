## Quick tutorial on unsupervised algorithm
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are sometimes known as **clustering algorithms**, they are usually used as a exploratory analysis tool or understand data without a specific response variable. There are several types of models for different use cases. 


In the next part, let's create a hypothetical scenario and walk through a potential use-case of clustering algorithm.

## Business context and objective
Let's pretend we are working for the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The FRA accident and safety director is interested to know the up-to-date geo-distribution on freight train accidents. Our task is to utilize the acident data and identify geographical hotspots in the U.S., in order to help direct efforts to reduce accidents. 

## Data 
The data can be downloaded from the FRA website here: https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety/publicsite/on_the_fly_download.aspx. The code below imports the downloaded CSV file and pre-process the data. For simplicity, the data clean up will be simplified as the actual analysis requires more complex methodology. 


```python
{
for i in is:
    print(i)
}
```
